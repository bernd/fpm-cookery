Welcome to the fpm-cookery documentation!
=========================================

**Current version:** |version|

fpm-cookery provides an infrastructure to automatically build software based on recipes. It's heavily inspired and borrows code from the great `homebrew <https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew>`_ and `brew2deb <https://github.com/tmm1/brew2deb>`_ projects.

Features
^^^^^^^^

* Source archive download and caching.
* Recipes to describe and execute the software build. (e.g. configure, make, make install)
* Sandboxed builds.
* Package creation via `fpm <https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm>`_.
* Standalone recipe trees/books/you name it. No need to put the recipes into the fpm-cookery source tree.
